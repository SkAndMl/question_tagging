631,"We can use run-length encoding (i.e., RLE) to encode a sequence of integers. In a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence.
For example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid RLE of arr.
Given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it.
Implement the RLEIterator class:
RLEIterator(int[] encoded) Initializes the object with the encoded array encoded.
int next(int n) Exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 instead.

Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.
You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:
During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.

If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.
If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.
We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.
Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

The grammar can best be understood through simple examples:
Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.

R(""w"") = {""w""}
When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}
R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)

892,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.
Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.
Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.
The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org
  The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:
philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).
Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".
Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.
For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].
The format of the output is as follows:
For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".
Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.
The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""].
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.
If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.
Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null

int getProduct(int k) Returns the product of the last k numbers in the current list. You can assume that always the current list has at least k numbers.
The test cases are generated so that, at any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.
The first effective comment takes precedence over others.
For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.
If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

1486,"Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent grid with a Quad-Tree.
Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing grid.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. Notice that you can assign the val to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
isLeaf: True if the node is a leaf node on the tree or False if the node has four children.
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.
If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
You don't need to read this section for solving the problem. This is only if you want to understand the output format here. The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.

The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. The old warehouse is on the right bank of the river, and the new warehouse is on the left bank of the river. Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the ith worker (0-indexed) can :
Cross the bridge from the left bank (new warehouse) to the right bank (old warehouse) in leftToRighti minutes.
Pick a box from the old warehouse and return to the bridge in pickOldi minutes. Different workers can pick up their boxes simultaneously.

Put the box in the new warehouse and return to the bridge in putNewi minutes. Different workers can put their boxes simultaneously.
A worker i is less efficient than a worker j if either condition is met:
leftToRighti + rightToLefti > leftToRightj + rightToLeftj

If a worker x reaches the bridge while another worker y is crossing the bridge, x waits at their side of the bridge.
If the bridge is free, the worker waiting on the right side of the bridge gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the right side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.

At the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:
If it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed since the last time the message was sent from this server.
Otherwise, no more resending will occur from this server.
The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.
Return the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.

You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

1990,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.
The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.
An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.
An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.
