0,"Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

8,"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.
Note:
Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
  Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.
Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)

26,"Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

80,"Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

If the length of the string is 1, stop.
If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.
  Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""great"", s2 = ""rgeat""
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.
""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".
""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.

Input: board = [[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""O"",""O"",""X""],[""X"",""X"",""O"",""X""],[""X"",""O"",""X"",""X""]]
Output: [[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""X"",""X"",""X""],[""X"",""O"",""X"",""X""]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
  Test case format:
For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
  Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
  Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
Example 2:
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3

155,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:
The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
Custom Judge:
The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):
intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
listA - The first linked list.
listB - The second linked list.
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.
  Example 1:
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.
Example 2:
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
Example 3:
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
  Constraints:
The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.
To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0.

int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.

  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

317,"Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:
Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.
In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
Note that the testcases are generated such that the file system is valid and no file or directory name has length 0.
  Example 1:
Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext""

Explanation: We have two files:

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence

            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.
Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
Example 2:

Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.

332,"A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.
Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.
If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.
  Example 1:
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.
Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.
If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
  Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

         7---8---9---10--NULL

The serialization of each level is as follows:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]

Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string startGene to a gene string endGene where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.
For example, ""AACCGGTT"" --> ""AACCGGTA"" is one mutation.
There is also a gene bank bank that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in bank to make it a valid gene string.
Given the two gene strings startGene and endGene and the gene bank bank, return the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from startGene to endGene. If there is no such a mutation, return -1.

377,"There are buckets buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.
You can feed the pigs according to these steps:
Choose some live pigs to feed.
For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
Repeat this process until you run out of time.
Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.
  Example 1:
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 15
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig buckets 1 and 2, and feed the second pig buckets 2 and 3.
At time 15, there are 4 possible outcomes:
- If only the first pig dies, then bucket 1 must be poisonous.
- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.
Example 2:
Input: buckets = 4, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: We can determine the poisonous bucket as follows:
At time 0, feed the first pig bucket 1, and feed the second pig bucket 2.
At time 15, there are 2 possible outcomes:
- If either pig dies, then the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.
- If neither pig dies, then feed the first pig bucket 3, and feed the second pig bucket 4.
At time 30, one of the two pigs must die, and the poisonous bucket is the one it was fed.

379,"Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.
Implement the LFUCache class:
LFUCache(int capacity) Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.
To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.
When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

Input

401,"You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.
Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).

In this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.
Your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:
Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.
If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.
Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board.

Given a string ring that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword.
Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the ""12:00"" direction. You should spell all the characters in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the ""12:00"" direction and then by pressing the center button.
At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:
You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the ""12:00"" direction, where this character must equal key[i].
If the character key[i] has been aligned at the ""12:00"" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.
  Example 1:
Input: ring = ""godding"", key = ""gd""
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character.

Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.
Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.
Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.
If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.
Quad-Tree format:
The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].
If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.
  Example 1:
Input: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]
, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.
If we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.
Notice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.
Example 2:
Input: quadTree1 = [[1,0]], quadTree2 = [[1,0]]
Output: [[1,0]]
Explanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.
The resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.

The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.
Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.
  Example 1:
Input: candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]

474,"Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.
A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:
The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.
  Example 1:
Input: code = ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.
Example 2:
Input: code = ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.
Example 3:
Input: code = ""<A>  <B> </A>   </B>""
Output: false
Explanation: Unbalanced. If ""<A>"" is closed, then ""<B>"" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

485,"Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.
Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.
  Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: ""1(2(4))(3)""
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be ""1(2(4)())(3()())"", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be ""1(2(4))(3)""
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]

id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.
  Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
""Leaf"": if the node is a leaf node.
""Root"": if the node is the root of the tree.
""Inner"": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

502,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.
Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.
You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.
A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.
Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
Example 2:
Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.
Example 3:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

You are given an integer array price where price[i] is the price of the ith item, and an integer array needs where needs[i] is the number of pieces of the ith item you want to buy.
You are also given an array special where special[i] is of size n + 1 where special[i][j] is the number of pieces of the jth item in the ith offer and special[i][n] (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the ith offer.
Return the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.
  Example 1:

505,"A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...
'Z' -> ""26""
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:
""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".
In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message ""1*"" may represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"". Decoding ""1*"" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.
Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
  Example 1:
Input: s = ""*""
Output: 9
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", or ""9"".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", and ""I"" respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode ""*"".
Example 2:
Input: s = ""1*""
Output: 18
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. ""11"" can be decoded to ""AA"" or ""K"").
Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode ""1*"".
Example 3:
Input: s = ""2*""
Output: 15
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", or ""29"".
""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", and ""26"" have 2 ways of being decoded, but ""27"", ""28"", and ""29"" only have 1 way.
Hence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode ""2*"".

519,"There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.
You are given a string moves that represents the move sequence of the robot where moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are 'R' (right), 'L' (left), 'U' (up), and 'D' (down).
Return true if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or false otherwise.
Note: The way that the robot is ""facing"" is irrelevant. 'R' will always make the robot move to the right once, 'L' will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.
  Example 1:
Input: moves = ""UD""
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.
Example 2:
Input: moves = ""LL""

562,"Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.
Implement the MyLinkedList class:
MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.
int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.
void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
void deleteAtIndex(int index) Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

Explanation: Deleting ""s"" from ""sea"" adds the ASCII value of ""s"" (115) to the sum.
Deleting ""t"" from ""eat"" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

574,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.
The first effective comment takes precedence over others.
For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.
If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.
For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.
Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
  Example 1:
Input: source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]

int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
The line by line output code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}
Example 2:
Input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].

581,"You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.
A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).
The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

585,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.
The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.
An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.
An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.
  Example 1:
Input: expression = ""(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))""
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.
Example 2:
Input: expression = ""(let x 3 x 2 x)""
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.
Example 3:
Input: expression = ""(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))""

Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.
For example, ""ABC"" represents a triangular pattern with a 'C' block stacked on top of an 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) block. Note that this is different from ""BAC"" where 'B' is on the left bottom and 'A' is on the right bottom.

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.
A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.
A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like ""2x"" or ""-x"".
Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction.
For example, expression = ""1 + 2 * 3"" has an answer of [""7""].
The format of the output is as follows:
For each term of free variables with a non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically.
For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".
Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.
The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.
An example of a well-formatted answer is [""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""].
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.
For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].
Note: You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

Input: answers = [1,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered ""1"" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit that answered ""2"" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered ""2"" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0]]
The two underlined bricks are no longer stable as they are no longer connected to the top nor adjacent to another stable brick, so they will fall. The resulting grid is:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0]]
Hence the result is [2].
Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]], hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [0,0]
Explanation: Starting with the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]
We erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
All remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall. The grid remains the same:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],

A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.
For example, starting with ""hello"", we could do an extension on the group ""o"" to get ""hellooo"", but we cannot get ""helloo"" since the group ""oo"" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like ""ll"" -> ""lllll"" to get ""helllllooo"".

Email address:
An email address is:
A name consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters, followed by
The '@' symbol, followed by
The domain consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters with a dot '.' somewhere in the middle (not the first or last character).
To mask an email:
The uppercase letters in the name and domain must be converted to lowercase letters.
The middle letters of the name (i.e., all but the first and last letters) must be replaced by 5 asterisks ""*****"".
Phone number:
A phone number is formatted as follows:
The phone number contains 10-13 digits.
The last 10 digits make up the local number.
The remaining 0-3 digits, in the beginning, make up the country code.
Separation characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '} separate the above digits in some way.

679,"You are given a string of digits num, such as ""123456579"". We can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].
Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list f of non-negative integers such that:
0 <= f[i] < 231, (that is, each integer fits in a 32-bit signed integer type),
f.length >= 3, and
f[i] + f[i + 1] == f[i + 2] for all 0 <= i < f.length - 2.
Note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.
Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from num, or return [] if it cannot be done.

680,"You are given an array of unique strings words where words[i] is six letters long. One word of words was chosen as a secret word.
You are also given the helper object Master. You may call Master.guess(word) where word is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from words. Master.guess(word) returns:
-1 if word is not from words, or
an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.
There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).
For each test case, you should call Master.guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:
""Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word."" if you called Master.guess more than allowedGuesses times or if you did not call Master.guess with the secret word, or
""You guessed the secret word correctly."" if you called Master.guess with the secret word with the number of calls to Master.guess less than or equal to allowedGuesses.
The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).
  Example 1:
Input: secret = ""acckzz"", words = [""acckzz"",""ccbazz"",""eiowzz"",""abcczz""], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess(""aaaaaa"") returns -1, because ""aaaaaa"" is not in wordlist.
master.guess(""acckzz"") returns 6, because ""acckzz"" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess(""ccbazz"") returns 3, because ""ccbazz"" has 3 matches.
master.guess(""eiowzz"") returns 2, because ""eiowzz"" has 2 matches.
master.guess(""abcczz"") returns 4, because ""abcczz"" has 4 matches.
We made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.

The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.

Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
  Example 1:
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
Example 2:
Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
Example 3:
Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].

You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:
Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].
This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
The game ends when you reach the square n2.
A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.
Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.
For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.

5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
Example 2:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

785,"You have an initial power of power, an initial score of 0, and a bag of tokens where tokens[i] is the value of the ith token (0-indexed).
Your goal is to maximize your total score by potentially playing each token in one of two ways:
If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play the ith token face up, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 score.
If your current score is at least 1, you may play the ith token face down, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 score.
Each token may be played at most once and in any order. You do not have to play all the tokens.
Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.
  Example 1:
Input: tokens = [100], power = 50
Output: 0
Explanation: Playing the only token in the bag is impossible because you either have too little power or too little score.
Example 2:
Input: tokens = [100,200], power = 150
Output: 1
Explanation: Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 50 and score becomes 1.
There is no need to play the 1st token since you cannot play it face up to add to your score.
Example 3:
Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200

Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:
1. Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 100 and score becomes 1.
2. Play the 3rd token (400) face down, your power becomes 500 and score becomes 0.

You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.
You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:
Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.
Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.
  Example 1:
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.

Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.
Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""YellOw"": correct = ""yellow""
Example: wordlist = [""Yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""Yellow""

Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yollow"": correct = ""YellOw""
Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yeellow"": correct = """" (no match)

809,"Given two strings s and t, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return true if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.
A rational number can be represented using up to three parts: <IntegerPart>, <NonRepeatingPart>, and a <RepeatingPart>. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:
<IntegerPart>
For example, 12, 0, and 123.

812,"You are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.
You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:
During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.
A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).
Return the number of good starting indices.
  Example 1:
Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.
Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].
During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].
We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.

824,"Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively. The root of the tree is at (0, 0).
The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.
Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
  Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.

Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
          1 is at the top, so it comes first.
          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.

For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.
We make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order.
For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.
However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.
  Example 1:
Input: s = ""abbaca""
Output: ""ca""
Explanation: 
For example, in ""abbaca"" we could remove ""bb"" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is ""aaca"", of which only ""aa"" is possible, so the final string is ""ca"".

Output: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 3 respectively.
The mean is (1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3) / 8 = 19 / 8 = 2.375.
Since the size of the sample is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements 2 and 3, which is 2.5.
The mode is 3 as it appears the most in the sample.
Example 2:
Input: count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.
The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).
Since the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.
The mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.

Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.
You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:
MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.
Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

907,"Under the grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words. Let R(expr) denote the set of words the expression represents.
The grammar can best be understood through simple examples:
Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.
R(""a"") = {""a""}
R(""w"") = {""w""}
When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}
R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)
When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
R(""{a,b}{c,d}"") = {""ac"",""ad"",""bc"",""bd""}
R(""a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}"") = {""abdfg"", ""abdfh"", ""abefg"", ""abefh"", ""acdfg"", ""acdfh"", ""acefg"", ""acefh""}
Formally, the three rules for our grammar:
For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.
For expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k >= 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) ∪ R(e2) ∪ ...
For expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) × R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed.

These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule.

We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with.

In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.
Note that the subarray needs to be non-empty after deleting one element.
  Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,-2,0,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: Because we can choose [1, -2, 0, 3] and drop -2, thus the subarray [1, 0, 3] becomes the maximum value.

A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.
For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.

bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.
Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

979,"On an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.
Given an array of integer coordinates queens that represents the positions of the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates king that represent the position of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can attack the King.
  Example 1:
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation:  
The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row. 
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column. 
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal. 
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [0,1]. 
The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [1,0]. 
The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same row/column/diagnal as the king.

980,"A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times.
Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: 34
Explanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34.

982,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.
Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.
Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.
The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org
  The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:
philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).
Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]
Explanation:
n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.
The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
- a is the id of a philosopher.

While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:
f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)
The function interface is defined like this:
interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns some positive integer f(x, y) for two positive integers x and y based on a formula.
  int f(int x, int y);
};
We will judge your solution as follows:
The judge has a list of 9 hidden implementations of CustomFunction, along with a way to generate an answer key of all valid pairs for a specific z.
The judge will receive two inputs: a function_id (to determine which implementation to test your code with), and the target z.
The judge will call your findSolution and compare your results with the answer key.
If your results match the answer key, your solution will be Accepted.
  Example 1:
Input: function_id = 1, z = 5

x=1, y=4 -> f(1, 4) = 1 + 4 = 5.
x=2, y=3 -> f(2, 3) = 2 + 3 = 5.
x=3, y=2 -> f(3, 2) = 3 + 2 = 5.
x=4, y=1 -> f(4, 1) = 4 + 1 = 5.
Example 2:
Input: function_id = 2, z = 5
Output: [[1,5],[5,1]]
Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 2 is f(x, y) = x * y.
The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
x=1, y=5 -> f(1, 5) = 1 * 5 = 5.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win, or ""Tie"" if they will end the game with the same score.

1170,"Given 2n balls of k distinct colors. You will be given an integer array balls of size k where balls[i] is the number of balls of color i.
All the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first n balls to the first box and the remaining n balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).
Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).
Return the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
  Example 1:
Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1
Example 2:
Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667
Example 3:
Input: balls = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.

  Example 1:
Input: names = [""pes"",""fifa"",""gta"",""pes(2019)""]
Output: [""pes"",""fifa"",""gta"",""pes(2019)""]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
""pes"" --> not assigned before, remains ""pes""
""fifa"" --> not assigned before, remains ""fifa""
""gta"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta""
""pes(2019)"" --> not assigned before, remains ""pes(2019)""
Example 2:

Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
""gta"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta""
""gta(1)"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta(1)""
""gta"" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since ""gta(1)"" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes ""gta(2)""

Given an integer array rains where:
rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.
Return an array ans where:
ans.length == rains.length
ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.
If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.
Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.
  Example 1:
Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.
Example 2:
Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].

1187,"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes ai and bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.
Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.
Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.
Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.
  Example 1:

Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.
Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.
  Example 1:
Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be ""a4"" of length 2.
Example 3:
Input: s = ""aaaaaaaaaaa"", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is ""a11"" of length 3.

For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]
Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.
Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).
  Example 1:

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.
Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder
For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.
In the beginning, curOrder will be [""king""].
Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice""].
Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""].
Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.
Implement the ThroneInheritance class:
ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.
void death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn't affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.
string[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

1278,"You have k servers numbered from 0 to k-1 that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.
You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.
Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.

Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
Output: [1] 
Explanation: 
All of the servers start out available.
The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.
Example 2:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
Output: [0]
Explanation: 
The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.
Example 3:

1288,"You are given an array of network towers towers, where towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi] denotes the ith network tower with location (xi, yi) and quality factor qi. All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.
You are also given an integer radius where a tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to radius. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.
The signal quality of the ith tower at a coordinate (x, y) is calculated with the formula ⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋, where d is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.
Return the array [cx, cy] representing the integral coordinate (cx, cy) where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate.
Note:
A coordinate (x1, y1) is lexicographically smaller than (x2, y2) if either:
x1 < x2, or
x1 == x2 and y1 < y2.
⌊val⌋ is the greatest integer less than or equal to val (the floor function).
  Example 1:
Input: towers = [[1,2,5],[2,1,7],[3,1,9]], radius = 2
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13.
- Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in ⌊7 / (1 + sqrt(0)⌋ = ⌊7⌋ = 7
- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in ⌊5 / (1 + sqrt(2)⌋ = ⌊2.07⌋ = 2
- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in ⌊9 / (1 + sqrt(1)⌋ = ⌊4.5⌋ = 4
No other coordinate has a higher network quality.
Example 2:
Input: towers = [[23,11,21]], radius = 9
Output: [23,11]
Explanation: Since there is only one tower, the network quality is highest right at the tower's location.

Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:
x % z == 0,
y % z == 0, and
z > threshold.
Given the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).
Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.

You are given a string keysPressed of length n, where keysPressed[i] was the ith key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list releaseTimes, where releaseTimes[i] was the time the ith key was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed. The 0th key was pressed at the time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous key was released.
The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[0].
Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key may not have had the same duration.
Return the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. If there are multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the keypresses.
  Example 1:
Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = ""cbcd""
Output: ""c""
Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).
Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29).
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49).
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).
The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20.
'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'.

- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.
Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

1337,"Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
There are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can remove a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may value the stones differently.
You are given two integer arrays of length n, aliceValues and bobValues. Each aliceValues[i] and bobValues[i] represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the ith stone.
The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play optimally. Both players know the other's values.
Determine the result of the game, and:
If Alice wins, return 1.
If Bob wins, return -1.
If the game results in a draw, return 0.
  Example 1:
Input: aliceValues = [1,3], bobValues = [2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
If Alice takes stone 1 (0-indexed) first, Alice will receive 3 points.
Bob can only choose stone 0, and will only receive 2 points.
Alice wins.
Example 2:
Input: aliceValues = [1,2], bobValues = [3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
If Alice takes stone 0, and Bob takes stone 1, they will both have 1 point.
Draw.
Example 3:
Input: aliceValues = [2,4,3], bobValues = [1,6,7]
Output: -1
Explanation:
Regardless of how Alice plays, Bob will be able to have more points than Alice.
For example, if Alice takes stone 1, Bob can take stone 2, and Alice takes stone 0, Alice will have 6 points to Bob's 7.
Bob wins.

1338,"You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.
You are given an array boxes, where boxes[i] = [portsi, weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and maxWeight.
portsi is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.
portsCount is the number of ports.
maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.
The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:
The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.
The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.
Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.
  Example 1:
Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.
So the total number of trips is 4.
Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).
Example 2:
Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
Example 3:
Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

1371,"A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.
The environment is represented by a grid of size rows x cols, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.
Players are represented by the characters 'C'(Cat),'M'(Mouse).
Floors are represented by the character '.' and can be walked on.
Walls are represented by the character '#' and cannot be walked on.
Food is represented by the character 'F' and can be walked on.
There is only one of each character 'C', 'M', and 'F' in grid.
Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:
Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.
During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the grid.
catJump, mouseJump are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
Staying in the same position is allowed.
Mouse can jump over Cat.
The game can end in 4 ways:
If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.
Given a rows x cols matrix grid and two integers catJump and mouseJump, return true if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return false.

For example, if word1 = ""abc"" and merge = ""dv"", then after choosing this operation, word1 = ""bc"" and merge = ""dva"".

For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire timeToLive seconds after the currentTime. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be extended to expire timeToLive seconds after the (potentially different) currentTime.
Implement the AuthenticationManager class:
AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) constructs the AuthenticationManager and sets the timeToLive.
generate(string tokenId, int currentTime) generates a new token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds.
renew(string tokenId, int currentTime) renews the unexpired token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given tokenId, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.
countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.
Note that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time t (renew or countUnexpiredTokens), the expiration takes place before the other actions.
  Example 1:
Input
[""AuthenticationManager"", ""renew"", ""generate"", ""countUnexpiredTokens"", ""generate"", ""renew"", ""renew"", ""countUnexpiredTokens""]
[[5], [""aaa"", 1], [""aaa"", 2], [6], [""bbb"", 7], [""aaa"", 8], [""bbb"", 10], [15]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, null, null, 0]

Explanation
AuthenticationManager authenticationManager = new AuthenticationManager(5); // Constructs the AuthenticationManager with timeToLive = 5 seconds.
authenticationManager.renew(""aaa"", 1); // No token exists with tokenId ""aaa"" at time 1, so nothing happens.
authenticationManager.generate(""aaa"", 2); // Generates a new token with tokenId ""aaa"" at time 2.
authenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(6); // The token with tokenId ""aaa"" is the only unexpired one at time 6, so return 1.
authenticationManager.generate(""bbb"", 7); // Generates a new token with tokenId ""bbb"" at time 7.
authenticationManager.renew(""aaa"", 8); // The token with tokenId ""aaa"" expired at time 7, and 8 >= 7, so at time 8 the renew request is ignored, and nothing happens.
authenticationManager.renew(""bbb"", 10); // The token with tokenId ""bbb"" is unexpired at time 10, so the renew request is fulfilled and now the token will expire at time 15.
authenticationManager.countUnexpiredTokens(15); // The token with tokenId ""bbb"" expires at time 15, and the token with tokenId ""aaa"" expired at time 7, so currently no token is unexpired, so return 0.

1429,"You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:
0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or
1 if it is a batch of sell orders.
Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.
There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:
If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog.
Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
  Example 1:
Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.
Example 2:
Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
Output: 999999984
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.
- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.
Example 2:
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.
The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.

The absolute sum difference of arrays nums1 and nums2 is defined as the sum of |nums1[i] - nums2[i]| for each 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).
You can replace at most one element of nums1 with any other element in nums1 to minimize the absolute sum difference.
Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array nums1. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
|x| is defined as:
x if x >= 0, or
-x if x < 0.
  Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]

Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].
Both will yield an absolute sum difference of |1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = 3.
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]

You want to maximize n's numerical value by inserting x anywhere in the decimal representation of n. You cannot insert x to the left of the negative sign.
For example, if n = 73 and x = 6, it would be best to insert it between 7 and 3, making n = 763.
If n = -55 and x = 2, it would be best to insert it before the first 5, making n = -255.
Return a string representing the maximum value of n after the insertion.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.
At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.
If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.
A server that is assigned task j at second t will be free again at second t + tasks[j].

1492,"You are given an integer hoursBefore, the number of hours you have to travel to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.
After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.
For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.
However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.
For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.
Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.
  Example 1:
Input: dist = [1,3,2], speed = 4, hoursBefore = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (1/4 + 3/4) + (3/4 + 1/4) + (2/4) = 2.5 hours.
You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.
Note that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.
Example 2:
Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) + (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.
You can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) + ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.

You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.
In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.
Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.
Example 2:
Input: n = 100
Output: 14
Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.

1504,"You are given two strings s and p where p is a subsequence of s. You are also given a distinct 0-indexed integer array removable containing a subset of indices of s (s is also 0-indexed).
You want to choose an integer k (0 <= k <= removable.length) such that, after removing k characters from s using the first k indices in removable, p is still a subsequence of s. More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 <= i < k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.
Return the maximum k you can choose such that p is still a subsequence of s after the removals.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
  Example 1:
Input: s = ""abcacb"", p = ""ab"", removable = [3,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, ""abcacb"" becomes ""accb"".
""ab"" is a subsequence of ""accb"".
If we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0, ""abcacb"" becomes ""ccb"", and ""ab"" is no longer a subsequence.
Hence, the maximum k is 2.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""abcbddddd"", p = ""abcd"", removable = [3,2,1,4,5,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: After removing the character at index 3, ""abcbddddd"" becomes ""abcddddd"".
""abcd"" is a subsequence of ""abcddddd"".
Example 3:
Input: s = ""abcab"", p = ""abc"", removable = [0,1,2,3,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: If you remove the first index in the array removable, ""abc"" is no longer a subsequence.
  Constraints:
1 <= p.length <= s.length <= 105
0 <= removable.length < s.length
0 <= removable[i] < s.length

1505,"A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.
To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].
Return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.
  Example 1:

The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.
For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
Player 1 competes against player 7.
Player 2 competes against player 6.
Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.
After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).
The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.

Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.
The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.
For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.
For example, if the game ended with num = ""243801"", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = ""243803"", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.

For example, if chairs 0, 1, and 5 are occupied when a friend comes, they will sit on chair number 2.
When a friend leaves the party, their chair becomes unoccupied at the moment they leave. If another friend arrives at that same moment, they can sit in that chair.

1537,"There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a unique color. You are given a 2D integer array segments, where segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori] represents the half-closed segment [starti, endi) with colori as the color.
The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were mixed when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.
For example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.
For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.
You want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.
For example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:
[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.
[4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.
Return the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are not painted). You may return the segments in any order.
A half-closed segment [a, b) is the section of the number line between points a and b including point a and not including point b.
  Example 1:
Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[4,7,7],[1,7,9]]
Output: [[1,4,14],[4,7,16]]
Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.
- [4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.
Example 2:
Input: segments = [[1,7,9],[6,8,15],[8,10,7]]
Output: [[1,6,9],[6,7,24],[7,8,15],[8,10,7]]
Explanation: The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,6) is colored 9 from the first segment.
- [6,7) is colored {9,15} (with a sum of 24) from the first and second segments.
- [7,8) is colored 15 from the second segment.
- [8,10) is colored 7 from the third segment.
Example 3:
Input: segments = [[1,4,5],[1,4,7],[4,7,1],[4,7,11]]

First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.
For example, if s = ""zbax"" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:
Convert: ""zbax"" ➝ ""(26)(2)(1)(24)"" ➝ ""262124"" ➝ 262124
Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8
Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.
  Example 1:
Input: s = ""iiii"", k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: ""iiii"" ➝ ""(9)(9)(9)(9)"" ➝ ""9999"" ➝ 9999
- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
Thus the resulting integer is 36.
Example 2:

Return a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of num.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

For example, [""one"", ""two"", ""three""] represents the path ""/one/two/three"".
Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.
For example, folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:

/a/x
/a/x/y
/a/z
/b
/b/x
/b/x/y
/b/z
However, if the file structure also included the path ""/b/w"", then the folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" would not be identical. Note that ""/a/x"" and ""/b/x"" would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Choose two elements x and y from nums.
Choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.
For example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.

The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.
The data structure should support the following functions:
Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.
Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.
Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:
The node is unlocked,
It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and
It does not have any locked ancestors.
Implement the LockingTree class:
LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.
lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from stones. The player who removes a stone loses if the sum of the values of all removed stones is divisible by 3. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn).
Assuming both players play optimally, return true if Alice wins and false if Bob wins.
  Example 1:
Input: stones = [2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The game will be played as follows:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove either stone.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the remaining stone. 
The sum of the removed stones is 1 + 2 = 3 and is divisible by 3. Therefore, Bob loses and Alice wins the game.
Example 2:
Input: stones = [2]

Explanation: Alice will remove the only stone, and the sum of the values on the removed stones is 2. 
Since all the stones are removed and the sum of values is not divisible by 3, Bob wins the game.
Example 3:

Explanation: Bob will always win. One possible way for Bob to win is shown below:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove the second stone with value 1. Sum of removed stones = 1.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the fifth stone with value 3. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 = 4.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array patience of length n.
All servers are connected, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.
The server labeled 0 is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.
At the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:

At second 1,
- Message 1A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back.
- Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message.
- Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B).

At second 2,
- The reply 1A arrives at server 1. No more resending will occur from server 1.
- Message 2A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 2A instantly and sends a reply 2A back.

The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.
Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every change minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.
The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.
For example the second minimum value of [2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2, 4] is 4.

1626,"A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.
A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.
A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.
Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.
Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance] where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and maxDistance is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].
  Example 1:
Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].
Example 2:
Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.
Example 3:
Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: There are two critical points:
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

1627,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing distinct numbers, an integer start, and an integer goal. There is an integer x that is initially set to start, and you want to perform operations on x such that it is converted to goal. You can perform the following operation repeatedly on the number x:
If 0 <= x <= 1000, then for any index i in the array (0 <= i < nums.length), you can set x to any of the following:
x + nums[i]
x - nums[i]
x ^ nums[i] (bitwise-XOR)
Note that you can use each nums[i] any number of times in any order. Operations that set x to be out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000 are valid, but no more operations can be done afterward.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert x = start into goal, and -1 if it is not possible.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,4,12], start = 2, goal = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: We can go from 2 → 14 → 12 with the following 2 operations.
- 2 + 12 = 14
- 14 - 2 = 12
Example 2:

1628,"An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:
Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.
Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.
For example, one way to encode an original string ""abcdefghijklmnop"" might be:
Split it as a sequence: [""ab"", ""cdefghijklmn"", ""o"", ""p""].
Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes [""ab"", ""12"", ""1"", ""p""].
Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: ""ab121p"".
Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.
Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.
  Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""internationalization"", s2 = ""i18n""
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that ""internationalization"" was the original string.
- ""internationalization"" 
  -> Split:       [""internationalization""]
  -> Do not replace any element
  -> Concatenate:  ""internationalization"", which is s1.
- ""internationalization""
  -> Split:       [""i"", ""nternationalizatio"", ""n""]

1639,"A string originalText is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string encodedText with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows rows.
originalText is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.
The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of originalText. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are filled with ' '. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in originalText.
encodedText is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.
The characters in the blue cells are appended first to encodedText, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed.
For example, if originalText = ""cipher"" and rows = 3, then we encode it in the following manner:
The blue arrows depict how originalText is placed in the matrix, and the red arrows denote the order in which encodedText is formed. In the above example, encodedText = ""ch ie pr"".
Given the encoded string encodedText and number of rows rows, return the original string originalText.

Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.
At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.
Thus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.
Example 3:
Input: n = 5, meetings = [[3,4,2],[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
Note that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.

There are at least time days before and after the ith day,
The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and
The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.
More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]. xi and yi denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the ith bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its range.
You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.
Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.
  Example 1:
Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]

Explanation:
The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.
Example 2:
Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]

Explanation:
Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.
Example 3:
Input: bombs = [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:
Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the 0th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.
In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.
Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and two integers capacityA and capacityB representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants.

Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.

Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.

1668,"You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.
The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.
For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:
arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)
However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).
In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.
  Example 1:
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.
Example 2:
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
Example 3:
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

1672,"You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:
Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.
For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.
Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.
For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.
Finally, represent the product as a string ""<pre>...<suf>eC"".

  Example 1:
Input: left = 1, right = 4
Output: ""24e0""
Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.
There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with ""e0"".
Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.

Explanation: The product is 39916800.
There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with ""e2"".
The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.

Explanation:
The above figure shows how the company will invite employees 0, 1, 3, and 4, and seat them at the round table.
Employee 2 cannot be invited because the two spots next to their favorite employee 1 are taken.
So the company leaves them out of the meeting.

The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:
Append any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its end.
For example, if the string is ""abc"", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be ""abcd"".

The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.
Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.

Explanation:
The first 3 characters ""abc"" form the first group.

Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,3,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,3], start = [2,3], k = 2
Output: [[2,1],[1,2]]
Explanation: You start at (2,3).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).
The ranks of these items are:
- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2
- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3
- (1,1) with distance 3
- (0,1) with distance 4
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).
Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3
Output: [[2,1],[2,0]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). 
The ranks of these items are: 
- (2,1) with distance 5
- (2,0) with distance 6
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0). 
Note that k = 3 but there are only 2 reachable items within the price range.

Explanation: Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is good.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is good.
- Person 2 states that person 1 is bad.
Let's take person 2 as the key.
- Assuming that person 2 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, person 1 is a bad person.
    - Now we know for sure that person 1 is bad and person 2 is good.
    - Based on the statement made by person 1, and since person 1 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. There will be a contradiction in this case and this assumption is invalid.
        - lying. In this case, person 0 is also a bad person and lied in their statement.

            - Following that person 2 is bad and lied, there will be two good persons in the group.
We can see that at most 2 persons are good in the best case, so we return 2.
Note that there is more than one way to arrive at this conclusion.

Explanation: Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is bad.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is bad.
Let's take person 0 as the key.
- Assuming that person 0 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 0, person 1 is a bad person and was lying.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 
Example 2:
Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

1709,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Rearrange the values of nums according to the following rules:
Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.
Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].
Example 2:

As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of the following three operations any number of times:
Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.
Return the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.

One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end. Time taken is 1.
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.

Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.
  Example 1:
Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3. Since num1 < num2, we subtract num1 from num2 and get num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
- Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.

Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 10, num2 = 10. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1 and get num1 = 10 - 10 = 0.

Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0].

You are also given another integer array nums. Return the array nums sorted in non-decreasing order based on the mapped values of its elements.
Notes:
Elements with the same mapped values should appear in the same relative order as in the input.
The elements of nums should only be sorted based on their mapped values and not be replaced by them.
  Example 1:
Input: mapping = [8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6], nums = [991,338,38]
Output: [338,38,991]
Explanation: 
Map the number 991 as follows:
1. mapping[9] = 6, so all occurrences of the digit 9 will become 6.
2. mapping[1] = 9, so all occurrences of the digit 1 will become 9.
Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669.
338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros.
38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros.
Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] denotes that there exists a directed edge from fromi to toi with weight weighti.
Lastly, you are given three distinct integers src1, src2, and dest denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.
Return the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph such that it is possible to reach dest from both src1 and src2 via a set of edges of this subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return -1.
A subgraph is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,2,2],[0,5,6],[1,0,3],[1,4,5],[2,1,1],[2,3,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,2],[4,5,1]], src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 5

Explanation:
The above figure represents the input graph.
The blue edges represent one of the subgraphs that yield the optimal answer.
Note that the subgraph [[1,0,3],[0,5,6]] also yields the optimal answer. It is not possible to get a subgraph with less weight satisfying all the constraints.

The number of collisions can be calculated as follows:
When two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by 2.
When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1.
After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.
Return the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.
  Example 1:
Input: directions = ""RLRSLL""
Output: 5
Explanation:
The collisions that will happen on the road are:
- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.
- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.

For s1 == ""b"", the longest common prefix is ""b"" which has a score of 1.
For s2 == ""ab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s3 == ""bab"", the longest common prefix is ""bab"" which has a score of 3.
For s4 == ""abab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s5 == ""babab"", the longest common prefix is ""babab"" which has a score of 5.
The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.
Example 2:
Input: s = ""azbazbzaz""
Output: 14
Explanation: 
For s2 == ""az"", the longest common prefix is ""az"" which has a score of 2.
For s6 == ""azbzaz"", the longest common prefix is ""azb"" which has a score of 3.
For s9 == ""azbazbzaz"", the longest common prefix is ""azbazbzaz"" which has a score of 9.
For all other si, the score is 0.
The sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.

1757,"You are given two strings current and correct representing two 24-hour times.
24-hour times are formatted as ""HH:MM"", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59.
In one operation you can increase the time current by 1, 5, 15, or 60 minutes. You can perform this operation any number of times.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert current to correct.
  Example 1:
Input: current = ""02:30"", correct = ""04:35""

Explanation:
We can convert current to correct in 3 operations as follows:
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes ""03:30"".
- Add 60 minutes to current. current becomes ""04:30"".
- Add 5 minutes to current. current becomes ""04:35"".
It can be proven that it is not possible to convert current to correct in fewer than 3 operations.

You are then given another integer newFlowers, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers target, full, and partial.
A garden is considered complete if it has at least target flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:
The number of complete gardens multiplied by full.
The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.
Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most newFlowers flowers.
  Example 1:

Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, ""346"" is replaced with ""13"" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.
Return s after all rounds have been completed.
  Example 1:
Input: s = ""11111222223"", k = 3
Output: ""135""
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: ""111"", ""112"", ""222"", and ""23"".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""3"" + ""4"" + ""6"" + ""5"" = ""3465"" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into ""346"" and ""5"".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""13"" + ""5"" = ""135"" after second round.

1773,"You are given a 2D integer array grid of size m x n, where each cell contains a positive integer.
A cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either horizontally or vertically up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the alternate direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.
The product of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.
Return the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path found in grid.
Note:
Horizontal movement means moving in either the left or right direction.
Vertical movement means moving in either the up or down direction.

1789,"Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The mapping of digits to letters is shown in the figure below.
In order to add a letter, Alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit i times, where i is the position of the letter in the key.
For example, to add the letter 's', Alice has to press '7' four times. Similarly, to add the letter 'k', Alice has to press '5' twice.
Note that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so Alice does not use them.
However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead.
For example, when Alice sent the message ""bob"", Bob received the string ""2266622"".
Given a string pressedKeys representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of possible text messages Alice could have sent.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
  Example 1:
Input: pressedKeys = ""22233""
Output: 8
Explanation:
The possible text messages Alice could have sent are:
""aaadd"", ""abdd"", ""badd"", ""cdd"", ""aaae"", ""abe"", ""bae"", and ""ce"".

Explanation: 
There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
  Example 1:

Return words after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, ""dacb"" is an anagram of ""abdc"".
  Example 1:
Input: words = [""abba"",""baba"",""bbaa"",""cd"",""cd""]
Output: [""abba"",""cd""]
Explanation:
One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
- Since words[2] = ""bbaa"" and words[1] = ""baba"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""baba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[1] = ""baba"" and words[0] = ""abba"" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[2] = ""cd"" and words[1] = ""cd"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd""].
We can no longer perform any operations, so [""abba"",""cd""] is the final answer.

1805,"You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.
You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.
Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
  Example 1:
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: 43
Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].
- The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.
- The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
- The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.

- The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.
The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.
Example 2:
Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

1806,"A concert hall has n rows numbered from 0 to n - 1, each with m seats, numbered from 0 to m - 1. You need to design a ticketing system that can allocate seats in the following cases:
If a group of k spectators can sit together in a row.
If every member of a group of k spectators can get a seat. They may or may not sit together.
Note that the spectators are very picky. Hence:
They will book seats only if each member of their group can get a seat with row number less than or equal to maxRow. maxRow can vary from group to group.
In case there are multiple rows to choose from, the row with the smallest number is chosen. If there are multiple seats to choose in the same row, the seat with the smallest number is chosen.
Implement the BookMyShow class:
BookMyShow(int n, int m) Initializes the object with n as number of rows and m as number of seats per row.
int[] gather(int k, int maxRow) Returns an array of length 2 denoting the row and seat number (respectively) of the first seat being allocated to the k members of the group, who must sit together. In other words, it returns the smallest possible r and c such that all [c, c + k - 1] seats are valid and empty in row r, and r <= maxRow. Returns [] in case it is not possible to allocate seats to the group.
boolean scatter(int k, int maxRow) Returns true if all k members of the group can be allocated seats in rows 0 to maxRow, who may or may not sit together. If the seats can be allocated, it allocates k seats to the group with the smallest row numbers, and the smallest possible seat numbers in each row. Otherwise, returns false.

Explanation: 
The words which represent prices are ""$1"" and ""$2"". 
- A 50% discount on ""$1"" yields ""$0.50"", so ""$1"" is replaced by ""$0.50"".
- A 50% discount on ""$2"" yields ""$1"". Since we need to have exactly 2 decimal places after a price, we replace ""$2"" with ""$1.00"".

1818,"The score of an array is defined as the product of its sum and its length.
For example, the score of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75.
Given a positive integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays of nums whose score is strictly less than k.
A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10
Output: 6
Explanation:
The 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:
- [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.
- [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.
- [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.
- [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. 
- [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.
- [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.
Note that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
Every subarray except [1,1,1] has a score less than 5.
[1,1,1] has a score (1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9, which is greater than 5.

Tax is calculated as follows:
The first upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent0.
The next upper1 - upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent1.
The next upper2 - upper1 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent2.
And so on.
You are given an integer income representing the amount of money you earned. Return the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
  Example 1:

Explanation:
Based on your income, you have 1 dollar in the 1st tax bracket and 1 dollar in the 2nd tax bracket.
The tax rate for the two tax brackets is 0% and 25%, respectively.
In total, you pay $1 * 0% + $1 * 25% = $0.25 in taxes.

Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.
Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.
If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
Otherwise, it is not a valid name.
Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
  Example 1:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:
Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.
For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = 6, 1 ^ 9 = 8, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.
Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: 9
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
- The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,5,2,4,4,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[5,2],[4,3],[1,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [3,4] with values [4,4]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.
- The 2nd component has nodes [1,0] with values [5,5]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.
- The 3rd component has nodes [2,5] with values [2,2]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.
We cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.

Input: nums = [""102"",""473"",""251"",""814""], queries = [[1,1],[2,3],[4,2],[1,2]]
Output: [2,2,1,0]
Explanation:
1. After trimming to the last digit, nums = [""2"",""3"",""1"",""4""]. The smallest number is 1 at index 2.
2. Trimmed to the last 3 digits, nums is unchanged. The 2nd smallest number is 251 at index 2.
3. Trimmed to the last 2 digits, nums = [""02"",""73"",""51"",""14""]. The 4th smallest number is 73.
4. Trimmed to the last 2 digits, the smallest number is 2 at index 0.
   Note that the trimmed number ""02"" is evaluated as 2.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [""24"",""37"",""96"",""04""], queries = [[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: [3,0]
Explanation:
1. Trimmed to the last digit, nums = [""4"",""7"",""6"",""4""]. The 2nd smallest number is 4 at index 3.
   There are two occurrences of 4, but the one at index 0 is considered smaller than the one at index 3.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
- The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
- The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
- The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

Picking up one unit of any type of garbage takes 1 minute.
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array travel where travel[i] is the number of minutes needed to go from house i to house i + 1.
There are three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house 0 and must visit each house in order; however, they do not need to visit every house.
Only one garbage truck may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up garbage, the other two trucks cannot do anything.
Return the minimum number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage.
  Example 1:
Input: garbage = [""G"",""P"",""GP"",""GG""], travel = [2,4,3]
Output: 21
Explanation:
The paper garbage truck:
1. Travels from house 0 to house 1
2. Collects the paper garbage at house 1
3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
4. Collects the paper garbage at house 2
Altogether, it takes 8 minutes to pick up all the paper garbage.
The glass garbage truck:
1. Collects the glass garbage at house 0
2. Travels from house 0 to house 1
3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
4. Collects the glass garbage at house 2
5. Travels from house 2 to house 3
6. Collects the glass garbage at house 3
Altogether, it takes 13 minutes to pick up all the glass garbage.
Since there is no metal garbage, we do not need to consider the metal garbage truck.
Therefore, it takes a total of 8 + 13 = 21 minutes to collect all the garbage.
Example 2:

a 2D integer array colConditions of size m where colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti].
The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.
You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.
The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:
The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.
The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.
Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.
  Example 1:
Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.
Example 2:
Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]

  Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
- Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
- Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.

Explanation: 
It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.

The ith player can match with the jth trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the ith player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the jth trainer can be matched with at most one player.
Return the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.
  Example 1:
Input: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]
Output: 2
Explanation:
One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:
- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.
- players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.

In other words, let Bij be the bitwise OR of the subarray nums[i...j]. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at i, such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to max(Bik) where i <= k <= n - 1.
The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.
Return an integer array answer of size n where answer[i] is the length of the minimum sized subarray starting at i with maximum bitwise OR.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,2,1,3]
Output: [3,3,2,2,1]
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise OR starting at any index is 3. 
- Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields it is [1,0,2].
- Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [0,2,1].
- Starting at index 2, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [2,1].
- Starting at index 3, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [1,3].

1938,"You are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers nums. For each integer in nums, you must find its respective second greater integer.
The second greater integer of nums[i] is nums[j] such that:
j > i
nums[j] > nums[i]
There exists exactly one index k such that nums[k] > nums[i] and i < k < j.
If there is no such nums[j], the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
For example, in the array [1, 2, 4, 3], the second greater integer of 1 is 4, 2 is 3, and that of 3 and 4 is -1.
Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the second greater integer of nums[i].
  Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,4,0,9,6]
Output: [9,6,6,-1,-1]
Explanation:
0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.
1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.
2nd index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 0, to the right of 0.
3rd index: There is no integer greater than 9 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
4th index: There is no integer greater than 6 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.
Thus, we return [9,6,6,-1,-1].
Example 2:

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.
Note:
The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.

You need to apply n - 1 operations to this array where, in the ith operation (0-indexed), you will apply the following on the ith element of nums:
If nums[i] == nums[i + 1], then multiply nums[i] by 2 and set nums[i + 1] to 0. Otherwise, you skip this operation.
After performing all the operations, shift all the 0's to the end of the array.
For example, the array [1,0,2,0,0,1] after shifting all its 0's to the end, is [1,2,1,0,0,0].
Return the resulting array.
Note that the operations are applied sequentially, not all at once.
  Example 1:

Explanation: We do the following operations:
- i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
- i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
- i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].

In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].

The positions of each robot are unique. The positions of each factory are also unique. Note that a robot can be in the same position as a factory initially.
All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.

Note that
All robots move at the same speed.
If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
